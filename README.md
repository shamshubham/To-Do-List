# To-Do List

This project is a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and remove tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Click on a task to mark it as complete (checked).
- **Remove Tasks**: Click the '×' button to remove a task from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage and persist across page reloads.

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todo-list
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the to-do list application.

## How It Works

1. **Add Task**: Enter a task into the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
2. **Mark as Complete**: Click on a task to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually indicated.
3. **Remove Task**: Click the '×' button next to a task to remove it from the list.
4. **Persistence**: The state of the to-do list (including tasks and their statuses) is saved in local storage and reloaded when the page is refreshed.
